            <h2>Live Breakwater!</h2>
            <p>
                During the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, the state of New York and SCAPE Landscape Architecture developed the "Living Breakwater" project, which focus on the theory of oysters being a plausible and a more adaptabel solution to storm surge,
                coastal flooding, and rising sea levels.
            </p>
            <h2>Why oyster?</h2>
            <p>
                <b>It's because of their life-cycle!</b> Oysters forms their hard shells from extracting calcium carbonate from its lime-rich water environment and they attach themselves to
                hard surfaces to live out the rest of their lives. The elements that the designers at SCAPE want to utilize is that they can attach themselves to the shells of oysters that passed,
                over time the accumulation of these oysters can forms a reef that is also adaptable changes in their enivronments, like sea level rising.<br>

            </p>
            <h2>Also biodiversity!</h2>
            <p>
                Oyster reefs are also habitats for multiple types of fishes in estuaries, the tidal mouthes of large rivers, of New York. From the increase of different species of fishes, other marine
                lives, like humpback whales, that has those fishes as food sources will also be attracted to the area. 
            </p>

            <h2>Here is the catch!</h2>
            <p>
                The original environments that oysters thirves in are gone, so conservationists found a lot of reef reconstruction attempts unsuccessful. Furthermore, a lot oysters ended up attaching themselves onto
                thrown away bottles, shoes, and other garbages.<br>
                In addition to the environmental struggles, there are also legal struggles. There are a lot hurddles to get over for growing oysters at a large quantities, as oysters are considered as "beneficail nuiances" by New York State laws.
                Hence,in effort to prevent health crisis and market disruption, the growing of them are heavily restricted and the harvesting, or selling of them is strictly outlawed.
            </p>

            <h2>There is hope!</h2>
            <p>
                SeArc, an Tel Aviv-based coastal engineering firm, designed an artifical reef base that mimics the wild reefs with recycled glass and reduced alkalinity. These are components that meets the biological needs of the oysters. Furthermore, as of 2021, there have been 11.2 million
                juvenile oysters that are added to the section of Hudson River that is part of lower Manhattan coast. So progress is still being made to achieve this potential of oysters.
