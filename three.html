           <p>Oysters are once <b>THE</b> food that are representative of New York City, specifically in the 19th century and early 20th century. They were sold by everyone, from nice restarurants to street vendors. This heavy demand was 
        also matched with the vast quantitiy of supplies. In lower Hudson estuary, there were 350 square milles of oyster beds.

        <p>
            So what happend? There are three main factors contributed to the drastic dying of oysters in NYC: overharvesting, lack of conservation efforts and pollution. The lack of conservation effort come from how the eaten oyster shells were being treated.They were often lefted in large piles, or turned into mortar paste to help build buildings, when those could have gone into regrowing of juvenile oysters.
            The overharvesting goes in hand-in-hand with the wastefulness of the oyster consumptions, due to oysters being a popular business venture. However, these two did not do as much of a impact as pollution did on the oyster population.

        <h2>Pollution</h2>
        <p>
            During early 20th century, city's sewage pollution and landfills have destroyed most of NYC's oyster beds. Then between 1947 and 1977, due to the banning of the production of PCBs from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), General Electric capacitor manufacturing plants dumped approximately 1.3 millions pounds of this pollutant into the Hudson river. This further exacerbated the conditions of the water and made the revitalization of the oyster population even harder.
